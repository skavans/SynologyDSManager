The app was initially developed by myself and for myself.
Then, for some time, it was the paid app, and I developed it following the customers' feature requests.

Since 2022, the Paddle platform I used for distributing the app, stopped working with sellers from Russia so I stopped working on this app.
Now in 2023 I decided to open-source it as is so you can use it for free.

I don't think I will actively improve the app by myself, but PRs for adding new features or fixing bugs are welcomed.
